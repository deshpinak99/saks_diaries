							<h1>The Kitchen En'counter'</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic0kit.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>S is cooking in the Kitchen. Cooking delicious meal for P and their kids. P has come home from office - (thakun baghun) , comes and kisses S  and checks thr fridge for something to eat. P asks her how her day was. S starts ranting about her day, P listens calmly. As she is talking he can feel her stressed and tired from all the stuff that is bothering her at work. P is on the "ota" while S cooks, as she is cooking she struggles to get her hair off of her face. P grabs the strand of hair and tucks it behind her ear and kisses her cheeks. P notices that S wants to get over with this thing. </p>
							<p>P hops off the counter and come behind S and tightly hugs her. S knows what's about to happen. P is turned on! he presses himself against her body. She can feel herself being pushed against the counter. S can feel his schlong against her ass. He takes her hands off the counter and starts kneading the dough. S twists her neck with her eye closed and starts kissing his neck. She takes her left hand and brushes his hair. When S licks his ear she can feel his schlong getting harder against her back. S starts grinding against P as he kneads the dough. Suddenly P starts thrusting into her, Once! then twice and then again and again. </p>
							<p>S is super turned on sandwiched between P and the counter, no-where to go. S grabs P, still standing in front of her and pressed herself against him. She slowly reaches his jeans and undoes his belt and slides her hand in his pants. Slowly pushing down, feeling his core and then going down she feels the base of his cock. She can feel the vein all pumped up for her. as she follows the vein with her finger, she reaches the centre of the cock and grabs it. P feels a rush going from her hands up to his head. S feels the cock pumping in her hands, see can feel the warm blood rushing through it. S loves how hard P is..... only for her. </p>
							<p>S starts jerking his cock. She can feel it rock hard against his skin. P aggressively starts kneading the dough. After some thrusting and jerking, S pulls out a finger from her grip and feels the pre-cum oozing out his tip. S turns aorund, still stuck in her place. Face to face with P, she can't stop herself and throws her hands across his shoulder and starts making out. Then P goes down to her boobs, smelling the beauty. She isn't wearing her bra. P can feel his nipples through her shirt with his lips. As he bites one S screams and pulls his hair hard. P aggressively pushes against her and kisses, S has to bend over her back as P comes on to her. </p>
